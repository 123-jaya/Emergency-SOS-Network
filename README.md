SOS Rescue Network 🚑🗺️

In times of disaster, every second counts. The SOS Rescue Network is here to help by using smart technology to track emergencies, prioritize urgent cases, and make sure help gets to the right places fast. Whether it's a fire, medical emergency, or natural disaster, this system keeps responders informed and ready to act.

🚀 What Makes This Project Stand Out?
* Live Emergency Map: See emergencies as they happen in real-time on a map.
* AI-Powered Priority System: The system uses AI to figure out which emergencies need attention first, ensuring resources are used wisely.
* Instant Alerts & Notifications: Get notified the moment an emergency is reported.
* Interactive Dashboard: A simple, easy-to-use interface that helps you manage emergencies and track updates.
* Smart Resource Management: The AI helps assign resources quickly and efficiently.

🧪 How It Works
* Live Emergency Tracking: The map shows all ongoing emergencies in real-time, along with the locations of responders.
* AI for Priority Tagging: The system automatically sorts emergencies by severity, so the most urgent cases are addressed first.
* Voice Reporting: You can report emergencies using voice commands, making it easier when you can't type.
